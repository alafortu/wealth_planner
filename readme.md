Financial Freedom Planner 🚀

A professional-grade, single-file web application designed to help users plan their escape from the rat race. This tool provides robust calculators for portfolio growth, savings goals, and retirement income simulation, wrapped in a modern, responsive "Fintech" interface.

✨ Key Features

1. 📈 Portfolio Growth Calculator

Visual Projections: Interactive bar charts showing the breakdown between principal contributions and compound interest.

Inflation Adjustment: Automatically calculates the "Real Value" of future wealth based on estimated inflation rates.

Flexible Inputs: Supports various contribution frequencies (Monthly, Quarterly, Annually, Bi-Weekly).

2. 🎯 Goal Planner

Reverse Engineering: Calculates exactly how much you need to save monthly or yearly to hit a specific financial target (e.g., your "Freedom Number").

Time-Based Analysis: Adjust the timeline to see how patience—or urgency—affects your required savings rate.

3. 💸 Income Simulator (Trinity Study Style)

Retirement Stress Test: Simulates portfolio drawdown over a 30-year period.

Market Volatility Mode: Includes a "Cone of Uncertainty" feature that visualizes optimistic (Bull) and pessimistic (Bear) market scenarios alongside the average projection.

Safe Withdrawal Rates: Test different withdrawal rates (e.g., the 4% rule) to see if your portfolio survives retirement.

4. 💾 State Persistence & Sharing

Shareable Links: Generates a unique URL containing the user's specific configuration to share with partners or advisors.

Save/Load Config: Export your scenario to a JSON file and reload it anytime.

Auto-Save: Automatically persists progress to the browser's local storage.

🛠️ Technical Stack

Core: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).

Visualization: Chart.js (via CDN).

Styling: Custom CSS variables for a "Dark Mode" aesthetic using Glassmorphism and the Inter font family.

Architecture: Single-File Component (SFC) structure — all logic, styling, and markup reside in one index.html file for easy deployment.

🚀 How to Run

Because this is a zero-dependency, single-file application, running it is incredibly simple:

Download the index.html file.

Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

That's it! No server, Node.js, or build steps required.

📱 Responsiveness

The interface is fully responsive:

Desktop: Two-column layout with side-by-side inputs and results.

Mobile: Stacked layout with touch-friendly sliders and optimized padding.
